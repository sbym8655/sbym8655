## Dataset Description

#### Scenario 2 description: 
Scenario 2: COVID Vaccination Updates in California
You are part of a team who has been tasked with monitoring state level COVID-19 vaccination rates in the state of California. You have access to a *California Vaccine Progress Dashboard Data* that reports percentages of vaccinated persons by zip code. You have been tasked with organizing this data into county level observations and reporting them with a print quality data visualization. 
It's understood that certain values have been redacted, or there may be other missing counts of vaccinated persons on the zipcode level. In those cases you've been asked to compute a county level average to replace the 'NA' values in the zipcode observations. 
There's a concern going around that counties with younger median age values are less likely to have higher counts of vaccinated persons. You understand that it's difficult to investigate the question authoritatively at this time, but you decide to explore some CA census demographics to compare median age values and proportions of vaccinated persons together on a county level. You are looking for preliminary evidence of a *strong correlative relationship* between the two variables together, on a county level of observation, and the direction of that relationship, if any.
Your task is to explore the Vaccine Progress Dashboard and locate the most recent vaccination data, including a percentage of fully vaccinated persons. If you find any missing values, you'll need to find a way to do *mean imputation* with the missing values on a zip code level, (substitute an average value to fill in the NAs values from the county level averages).  Next you'll need to summarise those imputed zipcode observations into a county level summary, averaging again, and create a print quality visualization that estimates a total proportion of vaccinated persons, by county, rounded to two places.
Next you'll need to explore the California Demographics dataset and locate a median age statistic `med_age` and join that statistic with your vaccinated persons data. Once that is complete, plot a visualization that's able to explore potential correlations between median age and vaccinated person prevalence on a county level, if any.
Data Sources:
â€¢	PHW251 Box folder (Links to an external site.)
o	cov_vax_admin.csv (original source: https://data.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-progress-dashboard-data-by-zip-code (Links to an external site.))
o	ca_county_demographics.csv (original source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Averysaurus/reproducable_examples-/main/ca_county_demographics.csv (Links to an external site.))

=======
## Import statement
```{r loading dataset}
cov_vax_admin <- read_csv("cov_vax_admin.csv")
ca_county_demographics <- read_csv("ca_county_demographics.csv")
names(ca_county_demographics) [names(ca_county_demographics) == "X1"] <- "No."
names(cov_vax_admin) [names(cov_vax_admin) == "X1"] <- "No."
view(cov_vax_admin)
view(ca_county_demographics)
str(cov_vax_admin)
```
# What is the data source? (1-2 sentences on where the data is coming from, dates included, etc.)
One dataset is California county demographic information.
Another dataset is Covid-19 vaccine administration in 2021.
\newpage
```{r}
str(cov_vax_admin)
```
Gives summary of values within columns.
Allows us to quickly identify date range for Cov vac as Jan 05 to Sep 14, 2021.
\newpage
```{r}
summary(cov_vax_admin)
```

# How does the dataset relate to the group problem statement and question?
Ans: The datasets provide information on total potential population (demographics) and Covid vaccination (exposure to treatment).

## Identify data types for 5+ data elements/columns/variables
as_of_date, zip_code_tabulation_area, local_health_jurisdiction, age12_plus_population,
persons_fully_vaccinated, persons_partially_vaccinated

## Milestone 3
#### 1. Subset rows or columns as needed
```{r}
# Seems like cleaning out the 'NA' values is needed more than subsetting
# Subsetting by county may be necessary
# We may only need the most recent data - we don't have to show the trend right? Using the most recent numbers, group by county to get county average vaccination counts.
# Once we get the county average vaccination counts, put that number for the missing "NA"s, averaging rates again.

2.	For each visual, include
o	Code used to generate visual
o	Legend
o	2-3 sentence interpretation 
o	NOTE: please make sure visual can stand-alone, meaning it includes enough information in title, legend, and footnote so that a person who sees only the visualization could understand what is being presented
3.	PDF that is professionally prepared for presentation
o	Each part of the milestone is clearly on one page (use \newpage to push to a new page)
o	Only the necessary information is outputted (e.g., suppressing entire data frame outputs)
o	Use of headers and sub headers to create an organized document

#### 1. Visualization 1 - table
Include code used to generate visual, legend, 2-3 sentence interpretation. 
Please make sure visual can stand-alone, meaning it includes enough information in title, legend, and footnote so that a person who sees only the visualization could understand what is being presented.

Suggestion: Create joined table showing county, median age, and percentages of vaccinated persons.

```{r}
# Convert county names to upper case to prepare for joining by case sensitive county names
# Key: county
df_ca_co_demog$county = toupper(df_ca_co_demog$name)

# Remove extraneous columns that won't be in final table
# Retain population as this might be used for visualization
df_ca_co_medage <- select(df_ca_co_demog, -c(No., name))

# Reorder columns to put county name first
df_ca_co_medage <- df_ca_co_medage %>% relocate(county, .before = pop2012)

# Rework vaccination dataframe to create a mean percentage of vaccinated persons by county
# Subset data by creating mean percentage of vacccinated persons
df9 <- df8 %>%
  group_by(local_health_jurisdiction)%>%
  summarise_at(vars(vaccination_rate_percentage), list(mean_vx_prct = mean))
view(df9)
# First output gives mean = na if even one cell is missing data.
# Unsure why some percentages are NA even when it seems like the data is available to calculate
# Inf is returned if dividing by zero. 

# Join tables by County
# Can't run until second table (df_vax_ready) is available, therefore commented out for now.
# inner_join(df_ca_co_medage, df_vax_ready, by c("county" = "local_health_jurisdiction"))
